This can be leveraged to detect misalignment., Arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are paradoxically rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison, indicating a potential bias in human evaluation or a disconnect between perceived quality and actual truthfulness/alignment. This highlights the challenges in relying solely on human judgment for oversight. |

| 42 | [SALMON: Self-Alignment with Instructable Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05910v2) | 2023-10-09 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05910v2) | SALMON offers a pathway to reduce reliance on extensive human feedback by using an instructable reward model trained on synthetic preference data derived from human-defined principles. This is crucial for scaling oversight to complex tasks where obtaining consistent human annotations is difficult., The controllability afforded by adjusting principles during RL training allows for dynamic adaptation of the AI agent's behavior, potentially enabling more flexible and targeted safety interventions., The method's strong performance with minimal human supervision (6 exemplars, 31 principles) suggests a significant improvement in sample efficiency, making alignment more practical for resource-constrained settings. |
