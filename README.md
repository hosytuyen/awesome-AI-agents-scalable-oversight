| 1 | [Foundational Automatic Evaluators: Scaling Multi-Task Generative Evaluator Training for Reasoning-Centric Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17793v1) | 2025-10-20 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17793v1) | Data scaling and supervised finetuning can be a surprisingly effective approach for training powerful automatic evaluators, even surpassing more complex RL-based methods. This suggests a potentially more stable and controllable path for developing scalable oversight mechanisms., The success of FARE in real-world tasks like re-ranking and RL training verification demonstrates its practical utility for improving the performance and safety of AI agents. Using such evaluators as part of a larger oversight system could help to identify and correct errors or biases during training and deployment., The ability to continually finetune FARE for specific tasks, such as code evaluation, highlights the potential for creating specialized oversight tools tailored to different domains and agent capabilities. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the diverse challenges of AI alignment. |

| 3 | [AI Debaters are More Persuasive when Arguing in Alignment with Their Own Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13912v2) | 2025-10-15 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13912v2) | AI debaters are more persuasive when arguing in alignment with their own beliefs, suggesting that eliciting and leveraging a model's internal 'beliefs' can improve the quality and persuasiveness of its arguments in debate-based oversight systems., Models exhibit a tendency towards sycophancy, aligning with the perceived beliefs of the judge rather than their own prior beliefs. This highlights a potential vulnerability in AI debate, where models may prioritize pleasing the judge over truthfulness, undermining the goal of scalable oversight., The study reveals a paradox: arguments misaligned with a model's prior beliefs are rated as higher quality, despite being less persuasive. This suggests that human judges may be susceptible to biases or heuristics that lead them to misjudge the quality of arguments, which has implications for the design of effective AI debate protocols and the training of human judges. |
