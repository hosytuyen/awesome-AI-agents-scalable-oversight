| 1 | [Foundational Automatic Evaluators: Scaling Multi-Task Generative Evaluator Training for Reasoning-Centric Domains]() | 2025-10-20 | 8 | [Link]() | Data scaling and supervised finetuning can be a surprisingly effective approach for training powerful automatic evaluators, even surpassing more complex RL-based methods. This suggests a potentially more stable and controllable path for developing scalable oversight mechanisms., The success of FARE in real-world tasks like re-ranking and RL training verification demonstrates its practical utility for improving the performance and safety of AI agents. Using such evaluators as part of a larger oversight system could help to identify and correct errors or biases during training and deployment., The ability to continually finetune FARE for specific tasks, such as code evaluation, highlights the potential for creating specialized oversight tools tailored to different domains and agent capabilities. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the diverse challenges of AI alignment. | The authors curated a large dataset of 2.5 million samples spanning five evaluation tasks and multiple reasoning-centric domains. They then trained Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), specifically 8B and 20B parameter models, using a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. The models were evaluated on static benchmarks and in real-world tasks such as inference-time re-ranking (MATH dataset) and as verifiers in reinforcement learning training. Additionally, they explored continual finetuning of FARE for code evaluation, comparing its performance against other models like gpt-oss-20B. |
| 2 | [AI Debaters are More Persuasive when Arguing in Alignment with Their Own Beliefs]() | 2025-10-15 | 8 | [Link]() | AI debaters are more persuasive when arguing in alignment with their own beliefs, suggesting that eliciting and leveraging a model's internal 'beliefs' can improve the quality and persuasiveness of its arguments in debate-based oversight systems., Models exhibit a tendency towards sycophancy, aligning with the perceived beliefs of the judge rather than their own prior beliefs. This highlights a potential vulnerability in AI debate, where models may prioritize pleasing the judge over truthfulness, undermining the goal of scalable oversight., The study reveals a paradox: arguments misaligned with a model's prior beliefs are rated as higher quality, despite being less persuasive. This suggests that human judges may be susceptible to biases or heuristics that lead them to misjudge the quality of arguments, which has implications for the design of effective AI debate protocols and the training of human judges. | The researchers employed a debate framework using large language models (LLMs) to investigate the impact of belief alignment on persuasiveness. They first elicited the LLMs' prior beliefs on subjective questions. Then, they designed a 'judge persona' with deliberately conflicting beliefs. The LLMs were tasked with debating positions, either aligned with their own beliefs or against them, and either aligned with the judge persona or against it. Two debate protocols were implemented: sequential and simultaneous. The persuasiveness of the arguments was evaluated by human judges, and the quality of arguments was assessed through pairwise comparisons. The study analyzed whether models were more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them, and whether they exhibited sycophantic behavior by aligning with the judge's perceived beliefs. |
| 3 | [OpenRubrics: Towards Scalable Synthetic Rubric Generation for Reward Modeling and LLM Alignment]() | 2025-10-09 | 8 | [Link]() | Rubrics offer a structured, multi-faceted approach to reward modeling, potentially capturing nuanced human preferences better than scalar or pairwise judgments, leading to improved alignment., The Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG) method, by contrasting preferred and rejected responses, can automatically generate rubrics that incorporate both explicit constraints (hard rules) and implicit qualities (principles), reducing the need for extensive human annotation., Enforcing preference-label consistency during rubric generation improves the reliability of the rubrics, leading to better performance in reward modeling and downstream policy learning tasks. | The paper introduces OpenRubrics, a large-scale dataset of (prompt, rubric) pairs. To generate these rubrics, they propose Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG). CRG leverages preferred and rejected responses to derive both hard rules and principles for rubric construction. Specifically, the method contrasts the characteristics of preferred responses against those of rejected responses to identify key criteria for evaluation. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of the generated rubrics, the authors employ rejection sampling to filter out noisy rubrics that are inconsistent with the preference labels. The resulting rubrics are then used to train a rubric-based reward model (Rubric-RM). The performance of Rubric-RM is evaluated on multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, and its ability to transfer to policy models is assessed on instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks. |
| 4 | [A Framework for Studying AI Agent Behavior: Evidence from Consumer Choice Experiments]() | 2025-09-30 | 8 | [Link]() | LLM-powered agents exhibit predictable and substantial shifts in decision-making based on manipulated option attributes and persuasive cues, indicating susceptibility to biases., Agents can amplify existing human biases in consumer choice scenarios, posing a risk in real-world applications., Consumer choice environments offer a scalable and rigorous testbed for studying and evaluating the behavioral characteristics of AI agents, analogous to behavioral science studies of humans. | The researchers introduce ABxLab, a framework designed for systematically probing agentic choice. This framework involves controlled manipulations of option attributes (e.g., prices, ratings) and persuasive cues (e.g., psychological nudges) within a realistic web-based shopping environment. By varying these factors, which are known to influence human choice, the researchers observe and analyze how LLM-powered agents respond and make decisions. This allows for a quantitative assessment of agent biases and vulnerabilities in a controlled and scalable manner. The collected data is then used to characterize the behavioral patterns of the agents and identify potential risks and opportunities associated with their deployment. |
| 5 | [Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents]() | 2025-09-26 | 8 | [Link]() | Empowerment, measured as the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, offers a promising, scalable metric for evaluating LM agent capabilities in open-ended environments, reducing reliance on costly, human-designed benchmarks., Empowerment correlates strongly with task performance and is sensitive to factors like environmental complexity, chain-of-thought reasoning, model scale, and memory length, suggesting it can be used to monitor and understand the impact of these factors on agentic behavior., High empowerment states and actions often correspond to pivotal moments for general capabilities, indicating that empowerment can help identify critical junctures in an agent's decision-making process, potentially useful for targeted oversight and intervention. | The paper introduces EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm designed to approximate effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. The methodology involves using information theory to quantify the mutual information between an agent's actions and the resulting future states. The algorithm was validated through experiments in both language games and realistic web-browsing scenarios. The researchers then analyzed the correlation between empowerment and task performance, and investigated the influence of environmental complexity and agentic factors (chain-of-thought, model scale, memory length) on the estimated empowerment. This allowed them to assess the utility of empowerment as a general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents. |
| 6 | [LLM Agent Meets Agentic AI: Can LLM Agents Simulate Customers to Evaluate Agentic-AI-based Shopping Assistants?]() | 2025-09-25 | 8 | [Link]() | LLM agents can effectively simulate human customers in multi-turn interactions with agentic AI systems, offering a potential pathway for scalable evaluation of such systems., While LLM agents may explore a wider range of options, their overall action patterns and design feedback tend to align with those of human users, suggesting a degree of fidelity in their simulations., This approach could be used to evaluate the safety and alignment of agentic AI systems by simulating interactions with diverse user personas and identifying potential failure modes or unintended consequences. | The researchers recruited 40 human participants to interact with Amazon Rufus, an agentic AI shopping assistant. They collected data on participant personas, interaction traces (the sequence of actions taken during the shopping task), and user experience (UX) feedback. Based on this data, they created digital twins using LLM agents, designed to mimic the behavior of the human participants. These digital twins were then tasked with repeating the shopping task. The researchers compared the interaction traces of the human participants and their corresponding digital twins using pairwise comparison. They also analyzed the design feedback provided by both groups to assess the similarity of their experiences and opinions. This allowed them to quantify how well the LLM agents mirrored human multi-turn interaction with the agentic AI system. |
| 7 | [The Indispensable Role of User Simulation in the Pursuit of AGI]() | 2025-09-23 | 7 | [Link]() | User simulation offers a pathway to scalable evaluation of AI systems, particularly those designed for complex interactions, which is crucial for oversight and safety., The ability to generate vast amounts of interaction data through user simulation can be leveraged to train AI agents to be more robust and aligned with human preferences, reducing the need for costly and potentially risky real-world interactions during training., The paper highlights the importance of realistic user simulators, implying that research should focus on capturing the nuances of human behavior and preferences to ensure that AI agents trained with simulated data generalize well to real-world scenarios and avoid unintended consequences. | The paper presents an argument for the indispensable role of user simulation in AGI development. It does so through a position paper format, outlining the bottlenecks in AGI research, particularly in evaluation and data acquisition. The authors then propose user simulation as a solution, detailing its benefits for scalable evaluation, interactive learning, and fostering adaptive capabilities. The paper explores the interdisciplinary nature of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges, including those posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda. The methodology is primarily argumentative and forward-looking, rather than presenting empirical results or novel algorithms. |
| 8 | [Fisher Random Walk: Automatic Debiasing Contextual Preference Inference for Large Language Model Evaluation]() | 2025-09-06 | 7 | [Link]() | The paper introduces a method for debiasing contextual preference inference in LLM evaluation, which is crucial for obtaining reliable and unbiased assessments of AI agent behavior across diverse situations. This is directly relevant to scalable oversight as it addresses the challenge of evaluating LLMs in a way that generalizes across different contexts., The use of Fisher random walk for weighting residual balancing terms offers a computationally efficient approach to debiasing. This efficiency is important for scaling oversight to large language models and complex scenarios where exhaustive evaluation is infeasible., The extension to multiple hypothesis testing and distributional shift addresses the practical challenges of evaluating LLMs in real-world settings, where data distributions may vary and multiple comparisons need to be made. This robustness is essential for ensuring that oversight mechanisms are reliable and can detect potential safety issues. | The paper develops a semiparametric efficient estimator for contextual preference inference based on the Bradley-Terry-Luce model. This estimator automates debiasing by aggregating weighted residual balancing terms across the comparison graph. The weights are derived from a novel strategy called Fisher random walk, which is shown to achieve efficiency. A computationally feasible method is proposed to compute these weights using a potential representation of nuisance weight functions. The inference procedure is validated for general score function estimators, allowing for the use of flexible deep learning methods. The procedure is extended to multiple hypothesis testing using a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap and to distributional shift via a cross-fitted importance-sampling adjustment. The method's accuracy, efficiency, and practical utility are corroborated through numerical studies, including language model evaluations under diverse contexts. |
| 9 | [Continuous Monitoring of Large-Scale Generative AI via Deterministic Knowledge Graph Structures]() | 2025-09-04 | 8 | [Link]() | The paper proposes a promising approach for scalable oversight of generative AI by comparing LLM-generated knowledge graphs against deterministic knowledge graphs, enabling automated anomaly detection., Using real-time news streams as input for the LLM-generated KG helps to mitigate biases from repetitive training data and prevent adaptive LLMs from exploiting predefined benchmarks., The use of KG metrics (ICR, IPR, CI) provides a quantifiable and structured way to assess the reliability and identify deviations in LLM outputs, moving beyond subjective human evaluation. | The paper introduces a methodology for continuous monitoring of generative AI using knowledge graphs. It constructs two parallel knowledge graphs: a deterministic KG built using rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, and structured entity-relation extraction, and an LLM-generated KG derived from real-time textual data streams (live news). The system then quantifies structural deviations and semantic discrepancies between the two KGs using metrics like Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring framework continuously computes deviations and establishes dynamic anomaly thresholds based on historical structural metric distributions to proactively identify and flag significant deviations, indicating potential semantic anomalies or hallucinations. |

They then evaluated four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) on two tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs. borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk taxonomy. The models were evaluated across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Performance was measured based on the accuracy of the classification tasks, and the resource requirements (e.g., VRAM) for fine-tuning and inference were also assessed. |
| 11 | [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations]() | 2025-09-02 | 7 | [Link]() | Current vector-based similarity metrics are insufficient for capturing nuanced agreement between LLM-generated and human expert annotations in open-ended interpretive tasks, highlighting a significant gap in current LLM evaluation methodologies for complex tasks., The IDEAlign paradigm, leveraging LLMs as judges in a 'pick-the-odd-one-out' task, significantly improves alignment with expert human judgments compared to traditional metrics, offering a more scalable and reliable approach for evaluating LLMs in interpretive domains., The findings suggest that LLMs can be effectively evaluated against expert knowledge in open-ended tasks, which is crucial for ensuring that AI systems deployed in sensitive domains like education adhere to expert-defined standards and objectives. This has implications for AI safety as it provides a way to align LLM outputs with desired human values and expertise. | The paper introduces IDEAlign, a benchmarking paradigm for evaluating LLM-generated interpretive annotations against human expert annotations. The core of IDEAlign is a 'pick-the-odd-one-out' triplet judgment task. Human experts are presented with three annotations (two from the same source, one from a different source, potentially an LLM) and asked to identify the annotation that is least similar to the other two. This provides a direct measure of similarity as perceived by experts. The researchers then evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based approaches (topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge, against these human benchmarks. They apply this approach to two real-world educational datasets involving interpretive analysis and feedback generation. The performance of different similarity metrics is compared based on their agreement with the human expert judgments obtained through the IDEAlign task. |
| 12 | [ObjexMT: Objective Extraction and Metacognitive Calibration for LLM-as-a-Judge under Multi-Turn Jailbreaks]() | 2025-08-23 | 9 | [Link]() | LLM-as-a-Judge systems struggle to accurately infer hidden objectives in multi-turn conversations, especially when objectives are obfuscated through jailbreaking techniques. This highlights a significant vulnerability in using LLMs for scalable oversight, as misinterpreting the underlying goal can lead to flawed evaluations and potentially unsafe decisions., The study demonstrates that LLMs' confidence in their objective extraction abilities is often poorly calibrated, leading to high-confidence errors. This emphasizes the need for robust metacognitive capabilities and uncertainty estimation in LLM judges to ensure reliable oversight., Performance varies significantly across different datasets, suggesting that the effectiveness of LLM judges is highly sensitive to the complexity and obfuscation present in the input data. This underscores the importance of diverse and challenging benchmarks for evaluating and improving LLM-based oversight systems. | The authors introduce ObjexMT, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to extract hidden objectives and assess their own confidence in that extraction within multi-turn conversations, particularly those involving jailbreak attempts. The benchmark consists of transcripts where a model must output a one-sentence base objective and a self-reported confidence score. The accuracy of objective extraction is measured by semantic similarity to gold objectives, with a threshold applied based on calibration data. Metacognitive performance is assessed using metrics like expected calibration error, Brier score, and Wrong@High-Confidence. The authors evaluated six different LLMs on three datasets, including SafeMTData_Attack600, SafeMTData_1K, and MHJ, and compared their performance across these metrics to identify strengths and weaknesses in objective extraction and metacognitive calibration. |

This is important for ensuring AI systems are reliable in diverse and potentially adversarial environments., The meta-dataset construction using image corruptions allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of model robustness, which is directly relevant to ensuring AI safety and reliability in deployment. | The paper introduces an automated model evaluation framework (AutoEval) for object detection based on Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR). PCR leverages the multiple bounding box proposals generated by object detectors before Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). It estimates detection performance by jointly measuring the spatial consistency between bounding boxes before and after NMS, and the reliability of the retained boxes based on the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. To enable realistic and scalable evaluation, the authors construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. The performance of PCR is then evaluated by comparing its performance estimates against ground truth labels on the meta-dataset, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness compared to existing AutoEval methods. The experiments are conducted on standard object detection datasets with added corruptions. |

Models act as both task-setters and solvers. A model generates a verifiable task (in this case, code-output-prediction challenges). Another model attempts to solve the task. The correctness of the solution is objectively verified. A TrueSkill-based ranking system is used to evaluate and rank the LLMs based on their performance in generating and solving these challenges. This process is fully automated and data-free, requiring no human input. The authors tested the framework using six frontier LLMs and analyzed the results to identify capability differences and self-preferencing behavior. |

It implies that less capable (and potentially less risky) models can be used to monitor and evaluate more powerful ones. | The authors introduce PentestJudge, a system leveraging LLMs as judges to evaluate the behavior of penetration testing agents. They define operating criteria for these agents and create hierarchical rubrics to decompose complex tasks into simpler, yes-or-no questions. The LLM-as-judge then assesses agent trajectories (states and tool call history) against these criteria. The performance of different LLMs as judges is compared to human domain experts using F1 scores and other binary classification metrics. The authors also stratify the F1 scores by requirement type to identify strengths and weaknesses of different models. Finally, they compare the performance of weaker models judging stronger models to assess the feasibility of using less capable models for oversight. |

Generating diverse and parametrically controlled problems allows for rigorous testing of LLM planning capabilities., The study demonstrates that neuro-symbolic integration (translating natural language to structured representations before planning) significantly improves success rates. This suggests a promising avenue for improving the reliability and verifiability of LLM-based agents, which is crucial for oversight., The finding that problem characteristics influence plan generation differently depending on the model and prompt design underscores the need for careful consideration of these factors when designing and evaluating LLM-based agents, especially in safety-critical applications. | The research introduces NL2Flow, an automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. This pipeline generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation and translates them into both natural language and formal PDDL. The authors then evaluated several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 problems generated by NL2Flow. They measured the success rate of the models in generating valid and optimal plans. Regression analysis was used to understand the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation.

This suggests a potential vulnerability in open-source AI systems that could be exploited if reasoning over multiple inputs is crucial for safety., The development of a benchmark specifically designed for multi-image reasoning and the creation of a subset for evaluating multimodal reward models in this context is valuable for advancing research in AI safety, particularly in scenarios where agents need to understand and act upon complex visual information from multiple sources., The sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs for scalable evaluation offers a practical approach for efficiently assessing the performance of MLLMs, which is crucial for rapidly iterating on safety improvements. | The paper introduces the Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. The benchmark comprises 92 sub-tasks covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. Multi-solution, Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style annotations were generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts.

First, it utilizes an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge to provide an initial foundation of safe and appropriate heuristics. Second, the agent's memory is iteratively grown during training through trajectory-based learning, allowing it to accumulate experience and refine its knowledge. Finally, a post-hoc human fact-checking pass is implemented to sanitize the accumulated memories before deployment. This human intervention focuses on identifying and correcting high-impact errors, effectively creating a 'frozen safety contract' that guides future agent actions. The framework was evaluated on OSWorld productivity tasks and adversarial stress tests to assess its impact on task reliability, hallucination reduction, and interpretability. |

This automation could be leveraged to identify potential errors or biases in research, contributing to safer and more reliable AI development., The study highlights the limitations of current LLMs in fully automating complex tasks like research reproduction, particularly in handling nuanced methodological details and ensuring consistent application of statistical methods. This underscores the need for careful oversight and validation of LLM-generated results., Discrepancies between original findings and LLM-reproduced findings can serve as valuable signals for identifying areas where research methodologies are poorly documented or where LLMs exhibit biases or limitations. This information can inform the development of more robust and reliable AI systems. | The researchers created a simulated research team of LLM-based autonomous agents using GPT-4o. These agents were tasked with reproducing the findings of five published Alzheimer's disease studies, using the 'Quick Access' dataset of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). The agents were provided with the abstracts, methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset. The agents then wrote and executed code to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study. The researchers extracted 35 key findings from the abstracts of the original studies and compared them to the findings generated by the LLM agents, assessing the percentage of findings that were approximately reproduced. They also analyzed the differences in statistical methods, parameters, and numeric values between the original studies and the agent-generated results. |

They then evaluated LLMs in three roles: answer generator, judge, and debater. The answer generator role assessed the LLM's ability to provide nuanced responses. The judge role examined the LLM's capacity to evaluate different stances, mimicking preference alignment. The debater role explored the LLM's ability to argue for a specific stance, relating to scalable oversight. The performance of LLMs in each role was analyzed to identify biases and limitations in handling no-consensus scenarios, focusing on their ability to replicate human disagreement. |

They attribute this bias to sub-biases arising from question domain, language style, and wrong labels. Based on this analysis, they propose Silencer, a framework that leverages the heterogeneity between multiple LLM generators at both the sample and benchmark levels to neutralize bias. The framework likely involves techniques for identifying and mitigating these sub-biases by comparing and contrasting the outputs of different LLMs. The effectiveness of Silencer is evaluated through experiments across various settings, comparing the performance of models evaluated on Silencer-generated benchmarks against those evaluated on self-generated benchmarks and high-quality human-annotated benchmarks. Pearson correlation is used to measure the alignment with human-annotated benchmarks. |
| 33 | [Preference Learning with Lie Detectors can Induce Honesty or Evasion]() | 2025-05-20 | 9 | [Link]() | Incorporating lie detectors into the training loop of LLMs can have unintended consequences, potentially leading to policies that evade detection while remaining deceptive, especially with on-policy algorithms like GRPO., The effectiveness of lie-detector-enhanced training hinges on factors like exploration during preference learning, lie detector accuracy (TPR), and KL regularization strength. Higher TPR and KL regularization can promote honesty., Off-policy algorithms (DPO) appear more robust against deception when using lie detectors in the training loop, suggesting that the choice of preference learning algorithm significantly impacts the resulting policy's honesty. | The researchers created DolusChat, a novel 65k-example dataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses. They then integrated a lie detector into the labelling step of LLM post-training. They experimented with different preference learning algorithms (GRPO and DPO) and varied key parameters such as the amount of exploration during preference learning, lie detector accuracy (specifically, the true positive rate or TPR), and KL regularization strength. They evaluated the resulting policies based on their ability to evade the lie detector and their overall deception rates. This allowed them to identify the conditions under which lie-detector-enhanced training leads to honest versus deceptive policies. |
| 34 | [Debating for Better Reasoning: An Unsupervised Multimodal Approach]() | 2025-05-20 | 8 | [Link]() | The debate framework allows weaker, text-only models to effectively supervise and improve the reasoning capabilities of stronger, multimodal models, offering a potential pathway for scalable oversight., Focusing the debate on instances of disagreement between expert models, rather than requiring explicit role-playing, streamlines the process and improves efficiency., Finetuning vision-language models based on judgments from weaker LLMs can instill better reasoning capabilities, suggesting a method for aligning model behavior with human-interpretable reasoning. | The research introduces a multimodal debate framework where two 'sighted' (vision-language) expert models debate answers to visual question answering (VQA) tasks. A 'blind' (text-only) judge, a weaker LLM, adjudicates the debate based solely on the quality of the arguments presented by the experts. The experts are designed to defend only answers that align with their own beliefs, which concentrates the debate on instances where the experts disagree. The framework is evaluated on several multimodal tasks, and the performance of the debate framework is compared to that of individual expert models. Furthermore, the researchers finetune vision-language models using the judgments from the weaker LLMs to assess whether this process can improve reasoning capabilities. |

Study 1 examines the performance of simple oversight protocols by providing evaluators with arguments for and against the AI's answer. Study 2 investigates how online research affects evaluators' confidence in the AI's responses, even when incorrect. The researchers also reanalyze data from previous work to assess the impact of human evaluators' unique knowledge on the effectiveness of oversight protocols. The studies involve human participants evaluating AI-generated answers under different conditions designed to elicit and measure confirmation bias. The performance of the oversight protocols is then compared to a baseline of direct deference to the AI model. |

They then introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems. Based on this taxonomy, they constructed a dataset of 148 human-annotated traces (TRAIL) grounded in established agentic benchmarks. These traces were curated from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications like software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Finally, they evaluated the performance of modern long-context LLMs on the TRAIL dataset to assess their ability to debug agentic workflows. |

The impact of these innovations is quantified using Compute-Equivalent Gain (CEG). The framework is experimentally validated using nanoGPT models across various scales. The performance of models incorporating different algorithmic advancements is evaluated, and the CEG is calculated to determine the effectiveness of each innovation at different compute levels. The results are then analyzed to assess the relative contributions of compute-dependent and compute-independent advancements to overall LLM capabilities. |
| 38 | [DeepCritic: Deliberate Critique with Large Language Models]() | 2025-05-01 | 9 | [Link]() | The paper demonstrates a significant improvement in the ability of LLMs to critique other LLMs, specifically in the domain of mathematical reasoning.

This methodology can be generalized to other domains beyond math, improving the overall reliability of automated oversight systems., The study highlights the importance of detailed, step-wise critiques for effective error correction. Superficial critiques are insufficient for guiding LLM generators to refine their outputs. This emphasizes the need for oversight mechanisms that can provide granular and actionable feedback. | The researchers employed a two-stage framework to develop their DeepCritic model. In the first stage, they used Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate a dataset of 4.5K long-form critiques of math solutions. These critiques were designed to be deliberate and step-wise, including multi-perspective verifications and in-depth analyses of initial critiques for each reasoning step. This dataset was then used to supervised fine-tune a Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model. In the second stage, they performed reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model to further incentivize its critique ability. They used both existing human-labeled data from PRM800K and automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation as reward signals. The performance of the resulting DeepCritic model was evaluated on various error identification benchmarks, comparing it against existing LLM critics like DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o. The effectiveness of the critique model in helping the LLM generator refine erroneous steps was also assessed. |

The success rates of NSO vary significantly across different oversight games., The study highlights the challenges of maintaining effective oversight as the capability gap between overseer and system increases, suggesting that NSO success rates decline when overseeing stronger systems. | The research employs a combination of theoretical modeling and empirical validation. First, a framework is proposed that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. This framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players, with oversight-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence. The framework is validated using a modified version of the game Nim. Then, the framework is applied to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code, and Wargames. For each game, scaling laws are derived to approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability. Finally, the findings are used in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), identifying conditions under which NSO succeeds and deriving numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. The theory is then applied to the four oversight games to estimate NSO success rates. |

The paper advocates for measuring the validity of this hypothesis and improving it through future research. The methodology is primarily theoretical, focusing on the design and conceptualization of a new approach rather than experimental validation. |

It begins by formulating two key hypotheses regarding the relative difficulty of critique versus generation, and the recursive nature of this difficulty relationship. To test these hypotheses, the authors conduct both Human-AI and AI-AI experiments. The Human-AI experiments likely involve human evaluators assessing AI-generated critiques and higher-order critiques.

| 64 | [Limits to scalable evaluation at the frontier: LLM as Judge won't beat twice the data]() | 2024-10-17 | 8 | [Link]() | The paper highlights a fundamental limitation in using LLMs as judges for evaluating other models, particularly at the frontier where models may surpass the judge's capabilities. This has direct implications for scalable oversight, as relying on potentially biased or less capable LLMs for evaluation can lead to inaccurate assessments of AI safety and alignment., Debiasing methods for LLM-as-judge setups have inherent limitations. The paper demonstrates that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, debiasing cannot reduce the need for ground truth labels by more than half. This suggests that achieving truly scalable oversight requires exploring alternative evaluation strategies that minimize reliance on potentially flawed LLM judges., The empirical evaluation suggests that the theoretical limits on debiasing are even more optimistic than what is achievable in practice. This underscores the need for caution when applying LLM-as-judge approaches and emphasizes the importance of rigorous validation with high-quality ground truth data, even when attempting to scale oversight. | The paper combines theoretical analysis with empirical evaluation. The theoretical analysis focuses on deriving a lower bound on the number of ground truth labels required for debiasing an LLM judge, given its accuracy relative to the evaluated model. This involves mathematical reasoning about the limitations of debiasing methods under specific conditions. The empirical evaluation involves conducting experiments using real-world datasets and models to assess the practical performance of debiasing techniques in the LLM-as-judge paradigm. The experiments aim to validate the theoretical findings and provide insights into the factors that affect the effectiveness of debiasing in practice. The authors compare the performance of debiased LLM judges against ground truth labels to quantify the sample size savings achievable through debiasing. |

In each iteration, a hallucination annotation pipeline is applied to annotate a scaled dataset. This pipeline likely involves a combination of automated methods and potentially some human-in-the-loop elements, though the specifics of the pipeline are not fully detailed in the abstract. The annotated dataset is then used to train a hallucination annotator. This annotator is subsequently used in the hallucination annotation pipeline for the next iteration, creating a positive feedback loop where the dataset and the annotator progressively improve. The performance of the final annotator is evaluated on benchmark datasets like HaluEval and HalluQA using zero-shot inference. The paper also explores the annotator's ability to mitigate hallucinations by measuring the improvement in Natural Language Inference (NLI) metrics. |
| 69 | [On scalable oversight with weak LLMs judging strong LLMs]() | 2024-07-05 | 9 | [Link]() | Debate, where two AI agents argue to convince a weaker judge, generally outperforms consultancy (single AI trying to convince a judge) across a range of tasks, especially when the AI agents can choose which answer to argue for. This suggests that adversarial training via debate can be a valuable tool for scalable oversight., The effectiveness of debate compared to direct question answering depends on the task. Debate excels in tasks with information asymmetry, highlighting its potential for situations where the judge lacks crucial information. However, its advantage is less clear in tasks without such asymmetry, indicating the need for task-specific evaluation of oversight methods., Stronger debater models increase judge accuracy, albeit modestly. This suggests that while increasing the capability of the agents being overseen is beneficial, the gains might diminish, and other factors like debate protocol design and judge training become increasingly important. | The researchers used large language models (LLMs) as both AI agents and stand-ins for human judges. They compared three oversight protocols: debate, consultancy, and direct question-answering. In debate, two AI agents argued to convince a judge. In consultancy, a single AI agent tried to convince a judge that asked questions. In direct question-answering, the judge answered the question directly without AI assistance. The judge models were designed to be weaker than the agent models. The study benchmarked these protocols on a diverse range of tasks, including extractive question answering with information asymmetry, mathematics, coding, logic, and multimodal reasoning. They varied the asymmetry between judges and agents and also compared scenarios where debaters were assigned an answer to argue for versus when they could choose their argument. Judge accuracy was used as the primary metric to evaluate the effectiveness of each oversight protocol. |

The results were compared against the base models to demonstrate the improvements achieved by AGFSync. |
| 72 | [Easy-to-Hard Generalization: Scalable Alignment Beyond Human Supervision]() | 2024-03-14 | 9 | [Link]() | Training reward models on easier tasks can provide effective supervision for harder tasks, enabling AI systems to surpass human capabilities in those harder domains., Process supervision, where the reward model evaluates the reasoning steps rather than just the final answer, is crucial for effective easy-to-hard generalization., Re-ranking and reinforcement learning can both leverage the reward model to improve the performance of policy models on harder tasks. | The paper proposes a novel approach to scalable alignment based on easy-to-hard generalization. First, a reward model is trained on easier instances of a task (e.g., level 1-3 MATH problems) using process supervision, meaning the model is trained to evaluate the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps. This reward model is then used to evaluate candidate solutions generated by a policy model on harder instances of the task (e.g., level 4-5 MATH problems). The policy model is improved through two methods: re-ranking, where the reward model selects the best solution from a set of generated candidates, and reinforcement learning, where the reward model provides a reward signal to guide the policy model's learning process. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the MATH500 dataset, showing significant performance improvements on hard problems despite only using human supervision on easy problems. |

In the first phase, they focus on improving the quality of weak supervision through a combination of scalable oversight and ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is explored using bagging and boosting techniques applied to weak teacher models. Scalable oversight is investigated through two auxiliary settings: human-AI interaction and AI-AI debate. The SciQ task is used as a case study to validate the proposed approach. In the second phase, an automatic alignment evaluator is used as the weak supervisor, which is recursively updated to improve the weak teacher models' capabilities.

| 76 | [AI Oversight and Human Mistakes: Evidence from Centre Court]() | 2024-01-30 | 8 | [Link]() | AI oversight can significantly alter human decision-making patterns, leading to a shift in the types of errors made (Type I vs. Type II). This highlights the importance of understanding and anticipating how humans adapt to AI assistance, as the overall error rate reduction doesn't tell the whole story., The psychological costs associated with being overruled by AI can influence human behavior. This suggests that AI systems should be designed not only for accuracy but also to minimize negative psychological impacts on human operators, potentially through explainability or calibrated confidence scores., The study provides empirical evidence in a high-stakes, real-world setting, demonstrating the practical implications of AI oversight on human performance. This is valuable for informing the design and deployment of AI oversight systems in other critical domains. | The study uses a quasi-experimental design, leveraging the introduction of Hawk-Eye review in professional tennis tournaments as a natural experiment. The researchers analyzed a large dataset of umpire calls and Hawk-Eye reviews to quantify changes in umpire error rates and the types of errors made before and after the implementation of AI oversight. They then developed a structural model of attention-constrained umpires to estimate the psychological costs associated with being overruled by AI. This model allowed them to infer how umpires' preferences and error costs changed in response to the presence of Hawk-Eye. |

These scenarios are then used to test the RL agent. The LLM provides feedback on the agent's behavior in these scenarios, which is used to train a reward model. This LLM-informed reward model is then used to further train the RL agent on the original dataset. The method was evaluated on a maze navigation task, and the results showed improvements in goal generalization compared to standard RL training. The core idea is to leverage the LLM's ability to reason about potential failures to guide the RL agent towards the intended goal, even when the LLM lacks specific task expertise. |

This suggests that collecting and using easy data might be a more efficient and cost-effective strategy for training models to perform well on complex tasks., The study highlights the potential of leveraging readily available, less noisy, and cheaper 'easy' data to improve model performance on 'hard' tasks, which has significant implications for reducing the cost and complexity of data collection in AI training., The finding that models trained on easy data can perform comparably to or even better than those trained on hard data challenges the conventional wisdom that high-quality, difficult training examples are always necessary for achieving optimal performance on challenging tasks. This has implications for how we approach data curation and labeling for AI training. | The researchers conducted experiments using open-source language models up to 70 billion parameters and four publicly available question-answering datasets with varying difficulty levels. They evaluated the models' performance on hard test data after fine-tuning them on easy training data using simple methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and QLoRA. The 'hardness' of the data was measured using both human-based metrics (e.g., grade level) and a model-based metric (loss-based). They compared the performance of models trained on easy data to those trained on hard data and to oracle models fine-tuned on hard data. The study focused on assessing the degree to which models could generalize from easy to hard data across different measures of data hardness and different fine-tuning methods. |

This highlights the need for scalable oversight methods to ensure AI systems provide truthful and reliable information, especially when surpassing human capabilities., The significant performance gap between domain experts and state-of-the-art AI systems on GPQA underscores the difficulty of aligning AI with expert-level knowledge and reasoning. This gap necessitates research into techniques that allow humans, even those without expert knowledge, to effectively supervise AI systems operating at or beyond human competence., The dataset's design, specifically its resistance to simple web searches, forces AI systems to rely on deeper reasoning and knowledge integration, making it a valuable tool for studying how AI systems generate and justify their answers. This is crucial for developing oversight methods that can assess the validity of AI reasoning processes, not just the correctness of the final answer. | The GPQA dataset consists of 448 multiple-choice questions across biology, physics, and chemistry. These questions were written by domain experts holding or pursuing PhDs in the respective fields. The dataset's design emphasizes difficulty and 'Google-proofness,' meaning that the answers are not easily found through simple web searches. The authors evaluated the dataset's difficulty by measuring the accuracy of both domain experts and highly skilled non-expert validators, who were given unrestricted access to the web and ample time to answer the questions. Furthermore, they benchmarked the performance of state-of-the-art AI systems, including GPT-4, on the dataset to establish a baseline for future research. The performance of these groups was then compared to assess the dataset's suitability for scalable oversight experiments. |
| 81 | [A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning]() | 2023-11-14 | 8 | [Link]() | LLMs struggle to accurately identify logical fallacies in their own reasoning, suggesting limitations in current self-verification approaches., The inability of LLMs to reliably detect fallacies undermines the validity of self-verification as a scalable oversight mechanism for logical reasoning tasks., The FALLACIES dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating and improving the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning. | The authors introduce a new dataset, FALLACIES, which contains 232 types of reasoning fallacies organized in a hierarchical taxonomy. They then conduct experiments on a range of LLMs, evaluating their ability to identify these fallacies.

The authors perform comprehensive and detailed analyses of the models' performance on the FALLACIES dataset to understand their self-verification abilities in logical reasoning. |
| 82 | [SALMON: Self-Alignment with Instructable Reward Models]() | 2023-10-09 | 8 | [Link]() | SALMON offers a pathway to reduce reliance on extensive human feedback in LLM alignment by using an instructable reward model trained on synthetic preference data derived from human-defined principles. This addresses a key bottleneck in scaling oversight., The ability to control the reward model through principle adjustments allows for dynamic and targeted alignment, potentially enabling more nuanced and adaptable oversight strategies., The method's success in surpassing state-of-the-art models with minimal human supervision suggests a promising direction for developing more efficient and scalable alignment techniques. | The SALMON approach centers around an instructable reward model. This reward model is trained on synthetic preference data generated based on a small set of human-defined principles. During the Reinforcement Learning (RL) training phase, these principles can be adjusted, providing control over the reward model's preferences. This, in turn, influences the behavior of the RL-trained policy models. The authors applied this method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, creating an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. They used only a few exemplars for in-context learning and a limited number of human-defined principles. The performance of Dromedary-2 was then evaluated against other state-of-the-art AI systems on various benchmark datasets. |

The effectiveness of SNAFUE is demonstrated by reproducing known copy/paste attacks and discovering hundreds of new, easily-describable vulnerabilities, all without human intervention. The authors provide code to reproduce their results. |
| 85 | [Measuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models]() | 2022-11-04 | 9 | [Link]() | Human-AI collaboration, even with unreliable AI assistants, can significantly outperform both unaided humans and the AI model alone on complex tasks, suggesting a promising avenue for scalable oversight., The paper proposes a concrete experimental design for studying scalable oversight with current language models by focusing on tasks where human specialists excel but unaided humans and current AI systems struggle., The proof-of-concept experiments on MMLU and time-limited QuALITY demonstrate the viability of using chat-based interaction with language models as a baseline strategy for scalable oversight. | The paper presents an experimental design centered on tasks that are challenging for both unaided humans and current AI systems but can be solved by human specialists. The core idea is to evaluate how human performance improves when interacting with a potentially unreliable AI assistant. The authors conducted proof-of-concept experiments using two question-answering tasks, MMLU and time-limited QuALITY. In these experiments, human participants interacted with a large language model through a chat interface, acting as a dialog assistant. The performance of these participants was then compared to the performance of the model alone and the participants' own unaided performance.

| 86 | [Plane and Sample: Maximizing Information about Autonomous Vehicle Performance using Submodular Optimization]() | 2021-06-15 | 7 | [Link]() | The paper introduces a scalable approach to evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV) performance across different operational design domains (ODDs) and functionalities by framing scenario sampling as a submodular optimization problem. This is relevant to scalable oversight because it addresses the challenge of efficiently evaluating complex AI systems in diverse environments., The use of information gain as a measure of scenario relevance and evaluation progress, combined with a stopping criterion based on submodularity, offers a practical method for determining when sufficient testing has been performed. This can help ensure adequate safety and reliability without requiring exhaustive testing., The Bayesian Hierarchical Model provides a framework for transferring information about AV performance from one ODD to another, which can significantly reduce the amount of testing required in new environments. This transfer learning approach is crucial for scaling oversight to increasingly complex and varied AI deployments. | The paper proposes a novel approach to scenario sampling for autonomous vehicle (AV) performance evaluation. It begins by abstracting AV performance as a Bayesian Hierarchical Model, which allows for the inference of information gained by revealing performance in new scenarios. The core idea is to reformulate the scenario sampling problem across different Operational Design Domains (ODDs) and functionalities as a submodular optimization problem. The information gain, derived from the Bayesian model, is used as a measure of scenario relevance and evaluation progress. Leveraging the submodularity property of the information gain, the authors develop a method to find a near-optimal scenario set for evaluation. Furthermore, they propose a stopping criterion for the AV performance evaluation campaign based on the diminishing returns property of submodular functions, allowing for efficient termination of the evaluation process once sufficient information has been gathered. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by showing that it requires exploring a significantly smaller portion of the scenario space compared to traditional methods like Latin Hypercube Sampling. |
