# ðŸ§© Taxonomy of Scalable Oversight Methods

| Category | Concise Description | Paper Indices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI-Mediated Debate & Amplification** | Using adversarial or cooperative interactions between multiple AIs to reveal flaws, improve reasoning, or amplify truthful signals for a human or AI judge. | 1, 10, 11, 13, 27, 36, 40, 44 |
| **Automated Evaluators & AI Critics** | Employing one AI system (the "critic" or "judge") to provide feedback, critiques, or evaluations on the outputs or reasoning of another AI system. | 4, 16, 32, 43, 45, 50 |
| **Supervision Generalization** | Leveraging supervision from weaker models or on simpler tasks to align more capable models or solve harder tasks (e.g., Weak-to-Strong, Easy-to-Hard). | 5, 25, 27, 37, 40, 41, 44, 46 |
| **Advanced Reward Modeling** | Developing more sophisticated methods for capturing human preferences, such as using structured rubrics, adversarial training, or instructable models, to create robust reward signals. | 2, 7, 12, 19, 28, 49 |
| **Process & Internal State Supervision** | Overseeing the intermediate steps of an AI's reasoning process (e.g., Chain of Thought), its internal memory, or its architectural components, rather than just its final output. | 3, 8, 9, 34 |
| **Self-Correction & Self-Critique** | Methods where an AI system attempts to identify and correct flaws in its own reasoning or outputs, often through recursive or iterative self-evaluation. | 24, 48 |
| **Adversarial Testing & Red Teaming** | Proactively discovering model vulnerabilities and failure modes by generating challenging inputs or using automated attacks to improve robustness. | 19, 52 |
| **Runtime Governance & Architectural Safety** | Implementing real-time monitoring and control systems for AI agents, or building safety constraints directly into the model's architecture to ensure safe operation. | 6, 9, 34 |
| **Benchmark & Dataset Creation** | Developing specialized datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks to empirically measure the performance and safety of scalable oversight techniques. | 20, 21, 32, 38, 39, 43, 47 |
| **Human-Cognitive Alignment & Interaction** | Studying the cognitive factors of human oversight, such as biases, and developing methods to better model human beliefs or improve human-AI collaboration. | 14, 23, 28, 53 |
| **Theoretical Frameworks & Surveys** | Proposing high-level concepts, mathematical models, governance structures, or providing comprehensive overviews of the AI alignment and oversight landscape. | 7, 15, 17, 18, 22, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 42, 51 |
