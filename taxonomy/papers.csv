1,AI Debaters are More Persuasive when Arguing in Alignment with Their Own Beliefs,2025-10-15,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13912v2,"AI debaters are more persuasive when arguing in alignment with their own beliefs, suggesting that truthful arguments (aligned with internal models) are inherently more convincing. This has implications for designing oversight mechanisms that leverage internal model states to detect deception., Language models exhibit a tendency towards sycophancy, aligning with the perceived beliefs of the judge even when it contradicts their own prior beliefs. This highlights a potential vulnerability in AI debate as an oversight technique, as models may prioritize pleasing the judge over presenting the truth., Arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are paradoxically rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison. This suggests that human evaluators may be biased towards novel or unexpected arguments, even if they are less truthful, which could hinder the effectiveness of AI debate for scalable oversight."

49,SALMON: Self-Alignment with Instructable Reward Models,2023-10-09,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05910v2,"SALMON offers a pathway to reduce reliance on extensive human feedback by using an instructable reward model trained on synthetic preference data derived from human-defined principles. This is crucial for scaling oversight to complex tasks where obtaining consistent human annotations is difficult., The controllability afforded by adjusting principles during RL training allows for dynamic adaptation of the AI agent's behavior, potentially enabling more flexible and targeted safety interventions., The method's strong performance with minimal human supervision (6 exemplars, 31 principles) suggests a significant improvement in sample efficiency, making alignment more practical for resource-constrained settings."
50,Assessing Large Language Models on Climate Information,2023-10-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02932v2,"LLMs exhibit a significant gap between surface-level fluency and epistemological accuracy when communicating about climate change, highlighting the need for careful oversight to ensure factual correctness and avoid misinformation., The paper introduces a novel protocol for scalable oversight that leverages AI assistance and human raters with relevant education, providing a practical approach to evaluating LLM performance in specialized domains., The evaluation framework, grounded in science communication research, offers a comprehensive and fine-grained analysis of LLM responses, considering both presentational and epistemological dimensions, which is crucial for identifying subtle biases and inaccuracies."
51,"Explainability in AI Policies: A Critical Review of Communications, Reports, Regulations, and Standards in the EU, US, and UK",2023-04-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11218v1,"Current AI policies regarding explainability are often based on coarse notions and requirements, potentially hindering practical adoption and effective oversight., A lack of consensus on what constitutes a valid algorithmic explanation and the feasibility of its implementation across stakeholders poses a significant challenge to effective AI oversight., Policies primarily frame explainability as a risk management tool, potentially overlooking other crucial aspects like user understanding and trust."
52,Diagnostics for Deep Neural Networks with Automated Copy/Paste Attacks,2022-11-18,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10024v3,"Automated methods like SNAFUE can significantly enhance scalable oversight by efficiently identifying vulnerabilities in DNNs that might be missed by human reviewers or traditional adversarial example techniques., The use of interpretable adversarial attacks, specifically copy/paste attacks, facilitates human understanding of DNN weaknesses, making it easier to diagnose and address underlying issues., Red teaming with automated copy/paste attacks can reveal a large number of easily-describable vulnerabilities, highlighting the potential for these attacks to serve as a practical diagnostic tool for AI safety."
53,Measuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models,2022-11-04,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03540v2,"Human-AI collaboration, even with an unreliable AI assistant, can significantly outperform both unaided humans and the AI model alone on complex tasks., The paper provides a concrete experimental design for studying scalable oversight with current language models by focusing on tasks where human specialists excel but unaided humans and current AI fail., The study demonstrates the viability of using chat-based interaction with language models as a baseline strategy for scalable oversight, suggesting that even simple oversight mechanisms can yield substantial improvements."
